# Exploring Data-Analysis

> This repo is a collection of data analysis projects.

Data Analysis is the process of cleaning, analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing data with the use of business intelligence tools and various other techniques. Tools for data analysis assist us in finding pertinent information that promotes more intelligent and successful decision-making. It is the methodical process of describing and illuminating, condensing and summarizing, and evaluating data using statistical and/or logical approaches. While statistical techniques may be used in data analysis for qualitative research, analysis frequently takes the form of an iterative process in which data is continuously gathered and examined nearly simultaneously. 

## Projects Involved:

- **Super-Store-Analysis:** Analysed the data of a super store and answered 3 factual questions based on the dataset.
- **Hotel-Reviews-Analysis:** Analysed about 20000 reviews about different hotels which I have scraped from TripAdvisor website.
- **Baby-Names-Analysis:** Gathered about 10,500 names of babies kept in different states of USA and analysed the trend and the occurence rate.
- **House-Price-Prediction:** Analysed about 21,000 house records which helps in analysing the house sale prices for King County including homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 .
- **Air-Quality-Index Analysis:** The higher the AQI value, the greater is the level of air pollution and thereby the health concern. This project helps to analyse the same using NDSAP portal's data of 435743 records.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Python is used for data analysis.
- **Data Extraction tools** Selenium or Beautiful-Soup for web-crawling.
- **Data Visualization tool** Tableau.

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Once cloned, you can view all the projects together within the same repo.
3. Based on your choice, you can run the project you want to analyze data of.
4. Feel free to raise issues if any and if you are willing to contribute then most welcome :smiley: by creating a fork of this repo.

## Installation  

There are 2 ways to run this project:
  
> Install python and setup the environment.

> Or upload this notebook to 
> 1. Google Colab (https://colab.google/) 
> 2. Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/?path=notebooks%2FIntro.ipynb)
  

## Run the Notebook

  

### If you are using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:

  

> Once you upload the notebook, ensure you add in the csv file to the same.

  

> Once both the files are uploaded, you are free to run the notebook online and view the insights gathered by me :star_struck:.

  

### If you are using Python environment

  

> Make sure python is rightly installed in the system using the following command -> python -v

  

> Create a directory and keep both the files in that directory.

  

> Once done, run all the cells of the notebook and check the insights.
