# Hotel-Reviews-Analysis Project

A Data Analytics project where sentiment analysis is performed on the reviews listed on [Trip advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/) website.


## Installation  

There are 2 ways to run this project:
  
> Install python and setup the environment.

> Or upload this notebook to 
> 1. Google Colab (https://colab.google/) 
> 2. Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/?path=notebooks%2FIntro.ipynb)

  

## Run the Notebook

  

### If you are using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:

  

> Once you upload the notebook, ensure you add in the csv file to the same.

> Please note, you will have to edit the file path of csv with your local file path.

> Once both the files are uploaded and the path is edited, you are free to run the notebook online and view the insights gathered by me :star_struck:.

  

### If you are using Python environment

  

> Make sure python is rightly installed in the system using the following command -> python -v

  

> Create a directory and keep both the files in that directory.

  

> Once done, run all the cells of the notebook and check the insights.
