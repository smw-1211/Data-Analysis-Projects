# Indian-Air-Quality-Data-analysis

## Project Description

This data is combined(across the years and states) version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).
      ROWS : 435743 COLUMNS :13

We performed diffrent regression and classification techniques to predict the data and validate the data across years and created a dashboard with the help of Tableau to visualize the techniques across maps.

## Installation  

There are 2 ways to run this project:
  
> Install python and setup the environment.

> Or upload this notebook to 
> 1. Google Colab (https://colab.google/) 
> 2. Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/?path=notebooks%2FIntro.ipynb)

  

## Run the Notebook

  

### If you are using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:

  

> Once you upload the notebook, ensure you add in the csv file to the same.

> Please note, you will have to edit the file path of csv with your local file path.

> Once both the files are uploaded and the path is edited, you are free to run the notebook online and view the insights gathered by me :star_struck:.

  

### If you are using Python environment

  

> Make sure python is rightly installed in the system using the following command -> python -v

  

> Create a directory and keep both the files in that directory.

  

> Once done, run all the cells of the notebook and check the insights.
